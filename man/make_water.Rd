\usage{
make_water(
  heightmap,
  waterheight = mean(heightmap),
  watercolor = "lightblue",
  zscale = 1,
  wateralpha = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{waterheight}{Default \code{0}.}

\item{watercolor}{Default \code{blue}.}

\item{zscale}{Default \code{1}. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis. For example, if the elevation levels are in units
of 1 meter and the grid values are separated by 10 meters, \code{zscale} would be 10.}

\item{wateralpha}{Default \code{0.5}. Water transparency.}
